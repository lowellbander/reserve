simple &amp; reliable room reservations

- recurring room reservations
- one-click room reservations
- ho shit wouldn't be awesome if you chose the room based upon where all of your attendees would be just before the event/meeting?
- Group by part of campus 
- Interactive map where you can click on a building 
- the map shows how many rooms are in the building, and offers data/attributes like occupancy, whether or not there is a projector 
- Have a user model so that you can at who has reserved the room in the past 
- Also a list view 
- Both list and map view allow for filtering by property, including popularity of room 
- Room reviews 
- Can be built upon the existing system by being a convenient front end for the already existing (and lame) email based schema
